# Bouncing Ball Android Game

## Description

The Bouncing Ball Game is a 2D animation app developed in Android Studio using Java. The game displays a ball bouncing around the screen, starting from the top and bouncing back and forth between the left and right edges of the screen.

## Features

1. **Set up the layout and views**: The game includes a Canvas view to draw the ball and a slider to control the speed of the ball.

2. **Implement the animation logic**: The game initializes the ball position and speed, sets up a timer to update the position of the ball every few milliseconds, updates the position of the ball based on its speed and direction, and detects when the ball hits the edges of the screen and makes it bounce back.

3. **Add finishing touches**: The game allows customization of the appearance of the ball, adds a background to the canvas, and has been tested on an emulator and a physical device.

## Setup

To set up the Bouncing Ball Game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone <repository-url>`.

2. **Open the project in Android Studio**: Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open the project in Android Studio.

3. **Run the app**: Click on the `Run` button in Android Studio to build and run the app. You can choose to run the app on an emulator or on an Android device connected to your computer.
